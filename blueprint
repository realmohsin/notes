Many on the Rejuvenation Olympics leaderboard are not taking supplements AT ALL. Think about this: If the Blueprint stack was truly magic sauce, you'd see the leaderboard overrun with Blueprint customers. The fact that you don't, should tell you something.

If you feel the need to supplement at all, get a Micronutrients Analysis and supplement what you're actually deficient in. This will do miracles for your heath & longevity.
