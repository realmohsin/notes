Why use Docker? Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies.

What is Docker? Docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running containers. Docker can be referring to Docker Client, Docker Server, Docker Machine, Docker Images, Docker Hub, or Docker Compose.

Image - Single file with all the deps and config required to run a program.
Container - Instance of an image. Runs a program with it's own isolated set of hardware resources. 

Docker Client - Tool taht we are going to issue commands to.
Docker Server (Docker Daemon) - Tool that is responsible for creating images, running containers, etc

If you use ufw, be aware that when you expose container ports using docker, these ports bypass your firewall rules. For more info, check https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#docker-and-ufw. 

Installing Docker depends on environment. There are some restrictions such has Docker Desktop cannot be installed on OSes in a VM because 'Docker Desktop does not work with nested virtualization'.  

Docker Desktop on Linux runs a Virtual Machine (VM) which creates and uses a custom docker context, 'desktop-linux', on startup. 

Docker Desktop for Linux provides a user-friendly graphical interface that simplifies the management of containers and services. It includes Docker Engine as this is the core technology that powers Docker containers. Docker Desktop for Linux also comes with additional features like Docker Scout and Docker Extensions.

Installing Docker Desktop and Docker Engine
Docker Desktop for Linux and Docker Engine can be installed side-by-side on the same machine. Docker Desktop for Linux stores containers and images in an isolated storage location within a VM and offers controls to restrict its resources. Using a dedicated storage location for Docker Desktop prevents it from interfering with a Docker Engine installation on the same machine.

While it's possible to run both Docker Desktop and Docker Engine simultaneously, there may be situations where running both at the same time can cause issues. For example, when mapping network ports (-p / --publish) for containers, both Docker Desktop and Docker Engine may attempt to reserve the same port on your machine, which can lead to conflicts ("port already in use").

We generally recommend stopping the Docker Engine while you're using Docker Desktop to prevent the Docker Engine from consuming resources and to prevent conflicts as described above.

Use the following command to stop the Docker Engine service:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop docker docker.socket containerd
```
Depending on your installation, the Docker Engine may be configured to automatically start as a system service when your machine starts. Use the following command to disable the Docker Engine service, and to prevent it from starting automatically:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl disable docker docker.socket containerd
```

Switching between Docker Desktop and Docker Engine
The Docker CLI can be used to interact with multiple Docker Engines. For example, you can use the same Docker CLI to control a local Docker Engine and to control a remote Docker Engine instance running in the cloud. Docker Contexts allow you to switch between Docker Engines instances.

When installing Docker Desktop, a dedicated "desktop-linux" context is created to interact with Docker Desktop. On startup, Docker Desktop automatically sets its own context (desktop-linux) as the current context. This means that subsequent Docker CLI commands target Docker Desktop. On shutdown, Docker Desktop resets the current context to the default context.

Use the docker context ls command to view what contexts are available on your machine. The current context is indicated with an asterisk (*).
```bash
$ docker context ls
NAME            DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT                                  ...
default *       Current DOCKER_HOST based configuration   unix:///var/run/docker.sock                      ...
desktop-linux                                             unix:///home/<user>/.docker/desktop/docker.sock  ...        
```
If you have both Docker Desktop and Docker Engine installed on the same machine, you can run the docker context use command to switch between the Docker Desktop and Docker Engine contexts. For example, use the "default" context to interact with the Docker Engine:
```bash
$ docker context use default
default
Current context is now "default"
```

And use the desktop-linux context to interact with Docker Desktop:
```bash
$ docker context use desktop-linux
desktop-linux
Current context is now "desktop-linux"
Refer to the Docker Context documentation for more details.
```


## Manage Docker as a non-root user
The Docker daemon binds to a Unix socket, not a TCP port. By default it's the root user that owns the Unix socket, and other users can only access it using sudo. The Docker daemon always runs as the root user. If you don't want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group. On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package manager. In that case, there is no need for you to manually create the group.  (The docker group grants root-level privileges to the user. To run Docker without root privileges, see look online to run the Docker daemon as a non-root user (Rootless mode).)
