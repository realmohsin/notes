Big O is a way to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow.

O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
O(n^2)

The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that's less than or equal to one.

inserting into an array (besides at the end) is O(n) due to reordering of indexes thats needed
